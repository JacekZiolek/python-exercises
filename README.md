# Python exercises

This is the repository where I store various exercises aimed at practicing Python programming skills.
Each file is a separate problem along with my proposed solution. Feel free to use those as you see fit.

## Usage

```
mkdir -p path/to/chosen/directory/
```

```
cd path/to/chosen/directory/
```

And clone the repo. Most exercises can be run with:
```
python3 name_of_the_file.py
```
unless the exercise's doc string states otherwise.
